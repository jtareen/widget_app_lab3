# Widget App

This project is **Task 1** of **Lab 3** assignment for the **Mobile App Development Course**. The goal of this task is to create a Flutter app named `widget_app` that demonstrates the usage of common Flutter widgets, including `Text`, `Icon`, `ElevatedButton`, `Image`, `Row`, and `Column`.

## Project Overview

The `widget_app` showcases how various Flutter widgets can be combined to build a simple UI. The app layout includes:

- An **image** displayed at the top of the screen.
- A **row** of icons and text elements positioned below the image.
- An **elevated button** placed at the bottom of the screen.

The task involves constructing these elements within a `Column` widget, arranging them in a logical and visually appealing manner.
